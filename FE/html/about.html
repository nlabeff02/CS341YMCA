            <h1>About Us</h2>
            <p>The YMCA is more than just a gym; it's a community hub where people of all ages come together to improve their well-being, connect with others, and embrace healthy living. 
                For over 175 years, the Y has been a leading nonprofit organization committed to strengthening communities by focusing on youth development, healthy living, and social responsibility.

                Our programs are designed to nurture the potential of children and teens, improve the nation's health and well-being, and give back to our neighbors.
                At the YMCA, we believe that everyone—regardless of age, income, or background—deserves the opportunity to learn, grow, and thrive. From fitness classes and swimming lessons to after-school programs and summer camps, we offer a wide range of activities that support physical, mental, and emotional health. 
            </p>  
            <p>
                Whether you're looking to join a group exercise class, volunteer, or spend quality time with your family, the YMCA is here to support you every step of the way.
                Join us at the YMCA, where community and wellness meet!
